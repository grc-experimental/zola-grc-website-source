# On Foundations of Mathematics

## I. A Concrete Discomfort: Where Regress Quietly Appears

- Begin with a familiar definition (e.g. *structure*, *model*, or *category*).
- Observe the use of terms like:
  - “collection”
  - “consists of”
  - “object”
  - “map”
- Note that these terms are not defined within the theory being discussed.
- Emphasize that mathematics proceeds smoothly anyway.
- Do **not** yet name the regress; let it be felt.

---

## II. What a Foundation Actually Is

- Introduce the notion of a *foundation* explicitly.
- Describe its components:
  - a formal language,
  - a proof system (axioms and inference rules),
  - an interpretation or semantics,
  - a meta-theory.
- Emphasize:
  - a foundation is not ultimate bedrock,
  - it is a **designed stopping point**.
- Stress that foundations organize mathematics; they do not justify reasoning from nothing.

## III. Meta-Theory and Disciplined Informal Deduction

- Clarify what “informal” means:
  - finite reasoning,
  - explicit constructions,
  - induction on syntax and proofs.
- Explain why syntax, proofs, and models are reasoned about meta-theoretically.
- Briefly mention results of Gödel, Tarski, and Löwenheim–Skolem as boundary markers.
- Emphasize:
  - the meta-level is unavoidable,
  - it is stable and shared,
  - it is not a flaw.

## IV. Semantics as External Dependence

- Explain what a structure or model is.
- Describe how semantics assigns meaning externally to formal systems.
- Argue that:
  - no sufficiently strong foundation can fully supply its own semantics,
  - this is an instance of **external dependence**, not a defect.
